# Best Coffee in Town
This test Angular project will rate the top coffee shops in the Gastown, Vancouver area!

## Run it yourself
Install the Angular CLI Globally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Fork the repo
Either from me if you love coffee, or start fresh with `ng new YOUR-APP-NAME`

## Launch the server
You'll want to `cd YOUR-APP-NAME` & `ng serve --open` which will automatically build and launch your app at `http://localhost:4200/`
